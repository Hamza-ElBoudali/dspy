Question 1: Generate a poem with 10 lines. 
Vanilla Answer: The evening light shimmers on the shore  
Softly the waves echo around and more  
As I bask in the sun, my worries are all gone  
The sound of seagulls I now foolishly ignore  
Glistening sand beckons me with a silent plea  
Glistening seawater, cool to the touch and refreshingly free  
The evening brings peace, yet I can't find any  
But maybe in the morning there'll be time for me  
My bottled peacefulness, I uncork and pour  
The sound of the ocean lulls me even more
