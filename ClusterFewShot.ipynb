      "Example('question': Compare and contrast the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. , 'answer': The Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War were two of the largest and deadliest conflicts of the 20th century. The Cuban Missile Crisis involved a standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union over Soviet nuclear missile bases in Cuba, while the Vietnam War was a prolonged military conflict in Indochina between the North, which was backed by the Soviet Union and the South, which was backed by the United States. The Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded over a period of 13 days in October 1962, with the resolution coming in the form of a diplomatic agreement. The Vietnam War lasted for 19 years, beginning in 1954 and ending in 1973, with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. While both of these conflicts were Cold War related, they were also very different in terms of causes, objectives, strategic objectives and outcomes. The Cuban Missile Crisis did not result in any direct military conflict and was resolved primarily through diplomacy and the decision to withdraw nuclear weapons from Cuba. On the other hand, the Vietnam War was a prolonged series of battles resulting in significant losses for both sides. The Vietnam War also had a significant impact on the United States, as it highlighted the realities of a prolonged conflict and the limits of U.S. military intervention. Additionally, the Vietnam War also drastically changed the way public opinion viewed the military and the use of force.) (input_keys=['question', 'answer'])\n",

      "Example('question': Explain the concept of cogging torque. , 'answer': Cogging torque is the torque that is applied to a rotating device when the device experiences resistance from the teeth of the gears that are connected to the device. Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.)

      "Example('question': Explain the process of cellular respiration in plants. , 'answer': Cellular respiration in plants is a complex process in which the plant converts glucose into usable energy. The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle.) (input_keys=['question', 'answer'])\n",

      "Example('question': Outline the consequences of deforestation. , 'answer': Deforestation is the process of clearing and removing forests. The consequences of deforestation can include soil erosion, reduced water quality, decreased biodiversity, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and loss of habitat for wildlife. Soil erosion occurs when the trees that help retain water and soil are removed, leading to soil particles being washed away. This can cause siltation in rivers and streams, affecting water quality and leading to flooding. Additionally, when trees are removed, wildlife lose their habitat. This can cause species to become endangered, leading to further loss of biodiversity. Deforestation can also lead to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there are fewer trees to take up the gas during photosynthesis, which can contribute to climate change.)
